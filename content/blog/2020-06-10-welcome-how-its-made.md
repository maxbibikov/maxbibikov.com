Welcome to maxbibikov.com!

Hi, I am Max Bibikov, full-stack developer. In developer community there is a notorious tradition to write first blog post about tech-stack choice for personal website. Let's do it.

Not a long time ago I decided to build a personal website. With main purpose to show my short bio, contact page, some of my projects and share useful bits of technology related information as blog posts.

 I picked [JAM stack](https://jamstack.org/) architecture, which is a modern way of building static websites without being dependent on a web server. This approach suits well for required functionality of my site. JAM stack could consist of variety of tools, so let's get to it.

 After some research and previous experience, I decided to use [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) as a static site generator. It's based on React, has many useful plugins, decent documentation and community, it's very fast and i don't mind using GraphQL as additional layer to access data (some people count it as a confusing complication for simple websites). 

All content (e.g. this blog posts) is managed with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) and stored alongside source code in Git repository.

[](https://www.netlify.com/)For hosting, automatic builds and deploys on push changes to Git repository, [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) platform works really well.

I hope this will do for a short introduction to tech-stack behind this website.
